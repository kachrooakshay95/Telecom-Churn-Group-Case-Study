# Telecom-Churn-Group-Case-Study
ML Model to predict churn for a lending telecom operator in South East Asia

Objective of the Project
The main goal of the case study is to build ML models to predict churn. The predictive model that youâ€™re going to build will the following purposes:
to predict whether a high-value customer will churn or not, in near future (i.e. churn phase). By knowing this, the company can take action steps such as providing special plans, discounts on recharge etc.
to identify important variables that are strong predictors of churn. These variables may also indicate why customers choose to switch to other networks.
Recommend strategies to manage customer churn based on your observations.
Use a dimensionality reduction technique such as PCA to handle large number of attributes and then build a predictive model
